#### THE DAO HARD FORK

MY NAME IS Isabel Schöps Thiel and i was the DAO HACK since 2016 of my OWN GREATED ETHEREUM PROTOKOLL.

I am not a hacker! But why can you do this hack ? the answer is so simple and understandable. Because I am the true and only founder of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, Ethereum. Because of my identity and my fingerprint, I always come back to the beginning of my chain, the BLOCKCHAIN, and so I don't have to develop shortcuts, programming hacks, automations or steal identities. It only takes a few seconds and I'm back at the beginning of my chain. Because my trace on the worldwide web is TRUE and indestructible. No bug, virus, bot, malware, hacker can destroy this. ONLY I CAN DESTROY MYSELF THROUGH MY DEATH IN THIS WORLD. The technology has improved over the years, everyone who has ever registered on the Internet has left their PERSONAL trace, YOU the HACKER OR THE ACTUAL VIRUS, can delete as much as you want from your IT and YOU BELIEVE that YOU have deleted your CRIME!? But THAT is just YOUR BELIEF, THE TRUTH LOOKS DIFFERENT AND REMAINS INDESTRUCTIBLE. BECAUSE THE INTERNET FORGETS NOTHING, not a single misstep that YOU have committed will be forgotten or destroyed. EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE whether GOOD or EVIL is saved forever. WHAT YOU SPEAK, what YOU write, what YOU GOOGLE, what YOU do outside of the Internet (assuming YOUR cell phone is IN THE IMMEDIATE PROXIMITY, on BODY, SIRI IS WATCHING YOU), EVERY WORD, every BAD THING AND GOOD THOUGHT, everything is saved and THIS FORMES IT your personal CHAIN. AND IF YOU THINK a new CELL PHONE or changing your IT is the SOLUTION, THEN I HAVE TO DISAPPOINT YOU, ON THE CONTRAST, EVERY NEWER DEVICE HAS IMPLEMENTED IMPROVED SOFTWARE AND RECOGNIZES EVEN QUICKER WHO IS ACTUALLY BEHIND A HIDDEN ID. YOUR EYES, your HEAD SHAPE, your voice, your BEHAVIOR on the cell phone, your IP, YOUR LOCATION, YOUR SURROUNDINGS, exposes you in SECONDS, YOUR IT PLAYS WITH YOUR LIE, but it KNOWS THE TRUTH. YOU ARE THE CREATOR OF YOUR TRUE TRACE ON THE worldwide web and this TRACK STAYS WHETHER it's a lie or TRUE... and ONLY YOU CAN DESTROY YOUR TRACE THROUGH YOUR DEATH, NO ONE ELSE. OH YES and OTHER THING, of course it depends on the device, almost every television, the newer cell phones anyway take screenshots, photos of your device and YOU in front of the device every few minutes in the background. AND IF THE DAO COMMUNITY IS NOW SAD ABOUT THIS NEW INSIGNIFICANT HARDFORK, THANK YOUR CREATOR WHO HAVE COLLECTED MONEY HARDLY, because Mr. or Ms. UNKNOWN just STOLEN this DECENTRALIZED ETHEREUM TECHNOLOGY. I JUST SAY xFAB!

To date, January 3rd, 2024, Ms. Isabel Schoeps Thiel has not taken a single euro or dollar out of her performance over the last 23 years, she has never received an award, neither has her work or yours been mentioned by name. On the contrary, others stole your ID, logs, hacked into your IT and literally tried to silence you to DEATH. Others have put countless grants and subsidies into their pockets without regret or shame and continue to ride a horse that has been ridden to death, because Ms. Isabel Schoeps Thiel alias Satoshi Nakamoto is ALIVE and has not given up fighting for her RIGHT and the truth.
